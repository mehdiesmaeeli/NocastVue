combines an updated project renamer with an inbuilt keygen and online serial check bypass.
This allows all of my previous and future AspNetZero source releases to be used untouched / unpatched including the AspNetZero PowerTools direct from the marketplace.

    Auto renames source
    Autogenerates Key
    Auto inserts key into configs
    Automatically prevents online serial checks


Note: Online serial checks are prevented on the machine that generates the code only. Use the disable online checks button on any additional pc's or vms to disable online checks without regenerating code again.
